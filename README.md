Data_Cleaned_Checkpoint:
ðŸ“˜ Overview:

This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to the data cleaning phase, an essential part of preprocessing in both data analysis and machine learning workflows. It typically involves:
Importing datasets using tools such as pandas.
Addressing missing data by eliminating or imputing values.
Ensuring data type consistency (e.g., converting text to date/time or numeric formats).
Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain accuracy.
Renaming columns or adjusting formats for better readability.
Filtering out unnecessary or noisy data that could interfere with analysis or modeling.
Saving the refined dataset for downstream tasks like visualization or model training.

âœ… Objective:
To transform messy or raw datasets into a clean, organized structure that supports effective exploratory data analysis (EDA), insightful visualizations, or accurate machine learning models.
